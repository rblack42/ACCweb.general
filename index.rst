General Software Development Notes
##################################

..  include::   /references.inc

The notes in this section are designed to help my students at ACC get common
tools installed for classes they take as software developers. Some notes cover
specific tools I use in my classes, other notes cover basic concepts all
developers should know something about. I reference some of these notes in
specific classes, and there will be links to this section in notes for those
classes.

Feel free to try out these tools. I use all of the tools and concepts covered
here, both in my teaching, and personal development work.

Currently, I use the following systems for my work and in testing my software:

    * Windows: 64-bit Win7, Win10

    * Mac: 64-bit Sierra

    * Linux: 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04 (Server and Desktop)

..  note::

    I currently do not use any 32-bit systems. In some cases, you might need to
    be sure what processor is in the machine you intend to use for your work.
    If you have a 32-bit system, please make sure you pick the right version of
    tools for your machine.

    If you have problems following any material in these notes, please contact
    me at rblack@austincc.edu and I will try to update this material.
